# CO2-Injection-Rate-predictive-analysis
This study focuses on predicting the injection rate deltas (inj_diff) for carbon capture wells based on time series data and monitoring well parameters. To address this problem, a rigorous approach involving 15 distinct machine learning algorithms was utilized, alongside extensive feature engineering and feature selection processes. The selected models were carefully trained, evaluated, and compared to achieve optimal performance. An ensemble learning technique was employed to further enhance the prediction accuracy, achieving an impressive RÂ² score of 0.97 on the validation set. The model was successfully deployed on the iDareAI platform, providing a reliable tool for predicting injection rate deltas and validating carbon containment during the well injection process. The methodology developed serves as a crucial step towards monitoring and ensuring the integrity of carbon capture processes.
